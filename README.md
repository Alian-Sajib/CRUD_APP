# CRUD_APP
I am creating a CRUD Wep App via Django.

1. Firstly, Load the json data in django admin server using Postman.
2. Then Create a model according to the attribute.
3. About 15,934 data(which were provided) retrive from django admin panel and showed them in Homepage as Table. Adding a paginator     feature. Per page shows 10 rows.
4. The table is editable. After edit it, just refreh the page we can see the updated value. Also There is a delete option if we        want to delete something.
5. There is a Add new option where we can add new entry. Adding a Date picker feature also.

As I have no experience in React but have some experience in Javascript and python. So I am only focused on Backend.
